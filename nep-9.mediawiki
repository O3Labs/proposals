==Abstract==

This NEP describes a URI standard for transfer of NEO native assets.  

==Motivation==

Currently, there is no standard URI for NEO clients to consume. Bitcoin implements a URI standard so that clicking links or scanning QR codes can easily implement a bitcoin payment. Similarly the transfer of native assets on the NEO chain should be just as simple.

In the future this URI scheme should enable generic smart contract invocation. This would allow for transfer of NEP-5 tokens, but these extensions should be added on once the more basic URI standards are agreed upon

==Specification==

===Native Asset Transfer URI===

A native asset transfer would have the following URI. It describes the receiver address, assetID, and additional attributes that will be sent with the transaction. 

'''URI scheme: <code>neo</code>'''

<code>neo:<address>[?assetID=<assetID>][?amount=<amount>][?<TransactionAttributeKey>=<value>]</code>

==== URI Keys====
{| class="wikitable"
! Key
! Description
! Required
|-
| address
| Valid NEO Address
| âœ“
|-
| assetID
| ID of an asset being sent.
| -
|-
| amount
| amount of asset being sent. e.g 1.0
| -
|}

==== Available URI keys map to NEO transaction attribute keys ====

====Examples====

Begin transaction to specified address

<code>neo:AeNkbJdiMx49kBStQdDih7BzfDwyTNVRfb</code>


Begin transaction of unspecified amount of NEO

<code>neo:AeNkbJdiMx49kBStQdDih7BzfDwyTNVRfb?assetID=c56f33fc6ecfcd0c225c4ab356fee59390af8560be0e930faebe74a6daff7c9b</code>

Begin transaction to specified address of 1 NEO

<code>neo:AeNkbJdiMx49kBStQdDih7BzfDwyTNVRfb?assetID=c56f33fc6ecfcd0c225c4ab356fee59390af8560be0e930faebe74a6daff7c9b&amount=1.0</code>

Begin transaction to specified address of 1 NEO with transaction attribute description = "Hello"

<code>neo:AeNkbJdiMx49kBStQdDih7BzfDwyTNVRfb?assetID= c56f33fc6ecfcd0c225c4ab356fee59390af8560be0e930faebe74a6daff7c9b&amount=1.0&description=Hello</code>

Begin transaction to specified address of 0.1 GAS. Put public key in ecdh02 attribute field to allow sender to encrypt using ECDH. Transaction attribute description = "Hello"

<code>neo:AQc5mtFayAdoCK13BW1cGAzAHyo9SoUWe7?assetID= 602c79718b16e442de58778e148d0b1084e3b2dffd5de6b7b16cee7969282de7&amount=0.1&ecdh02=02ed53ad58c838435d4dd7a4b25c1eba01384c814ca53a539405434807afbb04b4&description=Hello</code>


This should be sufficient to facilitate transfer of native NEO assets safely.

==Rationale==

The URI needs to consider both ease of use for users and wallet developers as well as security implications, especially in the case of executing arbitrary smart contracts. We can make much easier security guarantees with URI's related to transfer native assets as opposed to smart contract invocation. For this reason we will propose generic smart contract URI's in a subsequent NEP.

The below discussion has many relevant talking points relevant to the security implications of smart contract URI's.
