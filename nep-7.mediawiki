==Abstract==

This NEP describes a URI standard for transfer of NEO native assets, as well as smart contracts deployed on chain.  

==Motivation==

Currently, there is no standard URI for NEO clients to consume. Bitcoin implements a URI standard so that clicking links or scanning QR codes can easily implement a bitcoin payment. Similarly the transfer of native assets on the NEO chain should be just as simple.

In the future this URI scheme should enable generic smart contract invocation. This would allow for transfer of NEP-5 tokens, but these extensions should be added on once the more basic URI standards are agreed upon

==Specification==

===Native Asset Transfer URI===

A Native asset transfer would have the following URI. It describes the reciever address, assetID, and additional attributes that will be sent with the transaction. The attributes are presented in raw hex data.

<code>NEO:<address>[?assetID=<assetID>][?attributes=<key>=<value>][?amount=<amount>]</code>

==== Available transaction attribute keys====

|}

====Examples====

Begin transaction to specified address

<code>NEO:AeNkbJdiMx49kBStQdDih7BzfDwyTNVRfb</code>


Begin transaction of unspecified amount of NEO

<code>NEO:AeNkbJdiMx49kBStQdDih7BzfDwyTNVRfb?assetID=c56f33fc6ecfcd0c225c4ab356fee59390af8560be0e930faebe74a6daff7c9b</code>

Begin transaction to specified address of 1 NEO

<code>NEO:AeNkbJdiMx49kBStQdDih7BzfDwyTNVRfb?assetID=c56f33fc6ecfcd0c225c4ab356fee59390af8560be0e930faebe74a6daff7c9b&amount=1.0</code>

Begin transaction to specified address of 1 NEO with transaction attribute Remark = "Hello"

<code>NEO:AeNkbJdiMx49kBStQdDih7BzfDwyTNVRfb?assetID= c56f33fc6ecfcd0c225c4ab356fee59390af8560be0e930faebe74a6daff7c9b&amount=1.0&attributes=0xf0=9048656c6c6f</code>

This should be sufficient to facilitate transfer of native NEO assets safely.

===NEP-5 Tokens===
A NEP-5 Token would have the following URI. 

<code>NEO:<address>?token=<tokenScriptHash>&method=<methodName>[?from=<NEOAddress>][?to=<NEOAddress>][?amount=<amount>]</code>

====Examples====
Getting balance of Account = AJShjraX4iMJjwVt8WYYzZyGvDMxw6Xfbe RPX Token Script Hash = 0xecc6b20d3ccac1ee9ef109af5a7cdb85706b1df9

<code>NEO:AJShjraX4iMJjwVt8WYYzZyGvDMxw6Xfbe?method=balanceOf&token=0xecc6b20d3ccac1ee9ef109af5a7cdb85706b1df9</code>

Transfer 100 RPX Token to=AJShjraX4iMJjwVt8WYYzZyGvDMxw6Xfbe
<code>NEO:AJShjraX4iMJjwVt8WYYzZyGvDMxw6Xfbe?method=transfer&token=0xecc6b20d3ccac1ee9ef109af5a7cdb85706b1df9&amount=100</code>



==Rationale==

The URI needs to consider both ease of use for users and wallet developers as well as security implications, especially in the case of executing arbitrary smart contracts. We can make much easier security guarantees with URI's related to transfer native assets as opposed to smart contract invocation. For this reason we will split up the URI's related to smart contract invocation, into two categories. Secure URI and Unsecure URI.



==Rationale==

The rationale fleshes out the specification by describing what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered and related work, e.g. how the feature is supported in other languages.

The rationale may also provide evidence of consensus within the community, and should discuss important objections or concerns raised during discussion.

==Test Cases==

Test cases for an implementation are mandatory for NEPs that are affecting consensus changes. Other NEPs can choose to include links to test cases if applicable.
